Sublime Text PostgreSQL Syntax Definition
=========================================

### Installation

With [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control):

1. Run `Package Control: Install Package` command, find and install `PostgreSQL Syntax Highlighting` plugin.
2. Restart Sublime Text editor (if required)

Using Package Control ensures package will stay up to date automatically.

Manually:

1. Clone or [download](https://github.com/tkopets/sublime-postgresql-syntax/archive/master.zip)
git repo into your packages folder (in Sublime Text, find `Browse Packages...`
menu item to open this folder)
2. Restart Sublime Text editor (if required)


### Usage

Open file with PostgreSQL commands and change syntax to `SQL (PostgreSQL)`.

To open all `*.sql` files using this syntax as default do the following.

1. Open `User` folder of Sublime Text (in Sublime Text, find `Browse Packages...`
menu item to open parent folder).
2. Create a file `PostgreSQL.sublime-settings` with the following contents:

```json
{
    // change default syntax highlight for *.sql files
    "extensions": [ "sql" ]
}
```
